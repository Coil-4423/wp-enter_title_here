`enter_title_here` is a built-in WordPress **filter hook** that is embedded into the WordPress core. It allows developers to customize the default placeholder text "Add title" that appears in the title field when creating or editing posts.

### Key details about `enter_title_here`:

1. **Purpose**: 
   - It is specifically designed to allow customization of the title placeholder text in the post editor screen. By default, WordPress uses "Add title" as the placeholder for all post types, but using this filter lets you modify it for specific custom post types.

2. **How it works**:
   - The `enter_title_here` filter passes the default placeholder text and the `$post` object as parameters to any function hooked to it.
   - You can return a different string (like "Add staff name" in your case) depending on the post type or any other condition.

3. **Location**:
   - The `enter_title_here` filter is used in the WordPress core, specifically in the code that handles rendering the post editor page. It is embedded in the core functions responsible for rendering the title input field.

   The relevant part of the WordPress core looks something like this:

   ```php
   <input type="text" name="post_title" size="30" value="" id="title" spellcheck="true" autocomplete="off" placeholder="<?php echo apply_filters( 'enter_title_here', __( 'Add title' ), $post ); ?>">
   ```

   In this code, the `apply_filters()` function applies any custom logic added via the `enter_title_here` filter, allowing the placeholder text to be modified.

### How `enter_title_here` Works:

- **Embedded Filter**: It is embedded within the WordPress core wherever the title input field is generated.
- **Filterable**: By attaching your function to the `enter_title_here` filter using `add_filter()`, you gain the ability to modify the placeholder text for different post types.

In your case, the `change_staff_title_placeholder` function you defined uses this hook to change the "Add title" placeholder to "Add staff name" when working with a custom post type called "Staff."
